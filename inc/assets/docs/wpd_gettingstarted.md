[GitHub Docsify](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify/)  

If this is your is not your first time using Docsify then some things may appear diffrently then the base application.  
In the top Wordpress Admin bar you will find a burger menu with the Docsify logo, This will allow you to close and hide the sidebar.  

## Setup
Creating your first documentation library is easy and should automatically appear once the folder is created.
To get started navigate to your theme directory and create a new folder called ```/documentation/``` 

!> Note we can change this base directory naming later on [Overides](wpd_overides.md#admin-menu).


## Default Documentation

All the Documentation is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) As so all the documentation will end in the ```.md``` filetype  
If you are not familar with the markdown you can copy the following documentation from this plugins assets to your newly created folder to get started  

```
wp-content/plugins/wpdocsify/inc/assets/docs/
````

## WP-Admin

Once you have completed creating your folder and placing your markdown in the folder check WP Admin again to see your new documentation library loaded from your themes folder
